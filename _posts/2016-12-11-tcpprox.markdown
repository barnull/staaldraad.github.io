On numerous occasions I've run into custom binary network protocols that I've wanted to reverse. The usual goto here is to fireup wireshark/tcpdump and view the traffic as it goes accross the wire. This works really well in most cases, but how about traffic that uses TLS to encrypt the traffic? Unless you have the private key for the server, you are stuck with viewing encrypted traffic in wireshark. Not ideal for reverse engineering.

To overcome this, I decided to find a TCP proxy capable of intercepting TLS traffic and allowing me to view the raw, unencrypted protocol, basically the same thing as what you get when using mitmproxy or Burp. Unfortunately I wasn't able to find anything to match my needs (admittedly I did a very lazy search and decided it's more fun to implement my own anyway). Armed with an excuse to do some more coding, [tcpprox.go](https://github.com/staaldraad/tcpprox) was born. The basic idea was to have two operating modes, plain-text and TLS enabled.

### Plain-text:
In this mode we setup a listen-connect proxy (bascially a socat tunnel), where we accept a connection, establish another connection to our target server, and then shunt all traffic between the two. Simple. This works great but doesn't really give you anything more than wireshark or tcpdump would. Natuarlly this is extendable and I've used it to modify traffic in-line, something along the lines of ```s/\x00\x01\x00\x01/\x01\x00\x01\x00/g``` where we simply replace byte patterns. Most of the time the nice hex-dump view is enough and what's needed to understand a protocol's functinality.

### TLS:
Here we setup a proper mitm proxy, where we still do a listen-connect proxy, however everything gets wrapped in TLS. This is where tcpprox has really worked well for me in the past. Especially when working on the RPC/HTTP component of [Ruler](https://github.com/sensepost/ruler), as it allowed me to actually see what is going on. Trying to use Burp/Fiddler on this traffic was usueless, as these proxies showed the first bit of the connection, the initial HTTP message, but failed to display the streaming data. Burp didn't show anything, while Fiddler stated that "RPC traffic can not be inspected".

With tcpprox, I was able to mitm the HTTPS connection (as HTTPS is a TLS-TCP connection with HTTP traffic), and inspect the traffic flowing between the client and server. Here it was possible to spot the DCERP traffic going across the wire and figure out what is needed to setup a correct connection.

## Using tcpprox:
Firstly, grab the source from Github - [https://github.com/staaldraad/tcpprox](https://github.com/staaldraad/tcpprox). You'll need a Go environment setup, sorry not going to help with this.

To use it without building,

```
go run tcpprox.go -l 127.0.0.1 -p 80 -r google.com:80
```

Our options are,
```
-l local IP address to listen on
-p local port to listen on
-r remote-ip/host:remote-port
```

Using tcpprox in TLS mode:

You'll need to generate a valid TLS certifcate here, the easiest is to use the following commands with OpenSSL:

```
openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048 openssl req -new -x509 -key server.key -out server.pem -days 365
```

Then convert it to DER format:

```
openssl x509 -in server.pem -out server.crt -outform der
```

Now you can simply start tcpprox with the ```-s``` to signal that it should use TLS:

```
go run tcpprox.go -s -l 127.0.0.1 -p 443 -r google.com:443
```

Finally you have the option of specifying everything in a config file and tcpprox will use these options to automatically generate a TLS certificate for you, ect ect.

```
{
    "remotehost":"targethost.com:1990",
    "localhost":"0.0.0.0",
    "localport":1990,
    "TLS":{
            "Country":["GB"],
            "Org":["YourOrg"],
            "CommonName":"*.domain.com"
    },
    "Certfile":""
}
```

Start tcpprox with the config file:  

```
go run tcpprox.go -s -c config.json
```

Hopefully this helps you to proxy, view and modify some TCP traffic in the future. As always, issues, suggestions and PRs are most welcome.
